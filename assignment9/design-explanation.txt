Following is a description of our design explaining our classes and how they work together.

The

Quick explanation of design:
To run, run Controller class and pass in inputs. The controller class basically calls View
class to ask for command line inputs. Then it takes command line inputs and checks if the
arguments/format is correct. If not, it returns an error message via the View class.
If there are no errors, it passes info into the Model class.

The Generate Mail class calls the CSVProcessor class and ReadTemplate class ...

The CSVProcessor class reads a CSV file. If there is an input or output exception, it is caught
and a message is given as the class continues processing and returns empty lists of headers and
member data. If there is no input or output exception, the processor reads the first line and
stores the information in a header list. Then it continues reading lines until the end of the file
and adding each line into a list of member data.
